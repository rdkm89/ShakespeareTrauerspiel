that mischeeueous potion was as yett vnserud 
it was a liqued bayne dissolud in wine 
w c h after supper should haue bene caroust 
to young king Richards health, 

lanc: 
good ifaith are his vncles deathes become 
health to king Richard: how cam it out 
S r thomas Cheney pray resolue vs [this doubt] 

Che: 
A Carmallit ffryer my lord reueald the plott 
and should haue acted itt, but tucht in conscience 
he came to yo r good brother; the lord protecto r . 
[25]  and soe disclosd itt; who straight sent me to yo u

to be protecto r to soe wyld a prince 

 


soe farr degenerate from his noble ffather 
[whome the trembling ffrench the blacke prince calld] 
[not of a swart and mellancholly brow] 
[for sweete & louely was his Countenance] 
[but that he mayd so many ffunerall dayes] 
[in mornefull ffrance: the warlicke battayles wonne] 
[at Cressey ffeild. poyteeres, Artoyse & Mayne] 
[maid all ffrance growne vnder his conquering Arme] 
but heauen fore stauld his diademe on earth 
to place hime w t h a royall Crowne in heauen. 
rise may his dust to glorye: ere h'eed a done 
a deede soe base vnto his enemye 
much less vnto the brothers of his ffather 
h'ed first haue lost his Royall blood in droops 
dissolud the strings of his humanytye 
& lost that liuelyhood that was preserud 
to make his (vnlike) sonne a wanton kinge 

yorke: 
for beare good Iohn of Gaunt, beleeue me brother 
we may doe wrong vnto o r Cossen kinge 
[.....] I feare his fflattering Mynions more then hime 

 



[.....] lanc: 
[50]  by the blest vergine, noble Edmond yorke 
Ime past all patience, poyson his subiects 
his royall vncles; why the proud Castillyan 
wher Iohn of Gaunt wrights king & soueraigne 
would not throwe off their vyld & servill yoake 
by trechery soe base; patience gratious heauen,

Ile be reuengd at full on all ther liues 

yorke: 
nay if yo r rage breake to such hye extreames 
yo u will preuent yo r self, & loose reuenge 

lanc: 
why Edmond canst tho u giue a reason yett 
though we soe neere in blood, his hapless vncles, 
[75]  (his grandsier Edwards sonnes; his ffathers brothers) 
should thus be mayd away, why might it be 
that Arondell and Surrey heere should dye 

Surry:

Arond: 
parhapps my office of the Admiralltye 
if a better & more fortunate hand, could gouerne itt 
I would twere none of myne 
yett thus much can I say; & make my praise 
no more then merrytt: A wealthier prize 
did neuer yett take harbour in o r Roodes 
then I to england brought; yo u all can tell 

 


full threescore sayle of tawle and lusty shipps 
and six great Carickes frought w t h oyle & wiñes 
I brought king Richard in aboundance home 
so much, that plentye hath so staild o r pallats 
as that a Tuñ of hye prizd wynes of ffrance 
is hardly worth a marke of english money 
If seruice such as this, done to my Country 
merritt my harte to bleed. lett it bleed freely 

lanc: 
wele bleed to gether warlicke Arondell 
Cussen of Surrye. princly Edmond yorke 
letts thinke on some reuenge: if we must dye

a coate of english freese, best pleaseth me 
how thinckes his vnsophisticated playnenes 
of theis bitter compounds, feares he no drugge
